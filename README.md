# SteamID-Scraper
Sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit

First project, some code written by ChatGPT, some by caffeinated schizo moments. 

Should work fine, but there are other, far better scrapers out there, this is just smth I wanted to do to learn Python better.

Option 1: Generates 3 character strings from all ASCII characters supported in Steam ID's
~~Option 2: Generates 3 character strings from ASCII characters in a specified .txt~~ I just realised this shit don't work and I am too lazy to fix it now. Soonâ„¢
Option 3: Generates strings from a wordlist specified in a .txt file

Use at your own risk, probably against Steam ToS.
